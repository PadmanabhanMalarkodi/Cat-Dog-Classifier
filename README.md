# Cat-Dog-Classifier
Welcome to CatDogClassifier, a powerful binary image classification project that distinguishes between cats and dogs with remarkable accuracy. This project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to make predictions based on image features and provides a foundation for similar classification tasks.
Whether you're a machine learning enthusiast, a pet lover, or someone looking to understand image classification, CatDogClassifier offers a practical example of how to tackle binary image classification problems. With a clear directory structure and thorough documentation, you can easily dive into the world of image classification and expand upon this project as needed.

## Introduction
* Image classification refers to grouping the images based on similar features. It is a supervised learning approach in which you are given a labeled dataset.
* Classifying cat and dog images is a common computer vision project, and you can approach it using various machine learning algorithms. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started on this project:

## 1. Set Up Your Environment:
* Install Python and necessary libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, scikit-learn.
## 2. Data Acquisition:
* Download the cat and dog image dataset from Kaggle or any other reputable source. Kaggle often provides preprocessed datasets, making it a convenient choice.
* You can download the data set from the given data source.

## 3. Data Exploration:
* Load the dataset and explore it to understand its structure, size, and the distribution of cat and dog images. Visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn can be helpful.
## 4. Data Preprocessing:
Prepare your data for training by performing the following tasks:
* Convert the image into numpy arrays as it is preferred for certain image processing tasks like reshaping. It is also preferred beacause certain machine learning algorithms expect input in the form of numerical arrays.
* Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
* Normalize pixel values to a common scale (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
* Convert the colored image into grayscale image as hog function in scikit-image is designed to work with grayscale images by default.
* Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
## 5. Feature Extraction (Optional):
* If you are using traditional machine learning algorithms, you can extract features from the images using methods like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), SIFT, or color histograms.
* In this project, I have used HOG for extracting features from an image. 
## 6. Model Selection:
* Decide on the machine learning algorithm you want to use. You have several options:
* Traditional machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
## 7. Model Training:
* Train your model with the train data set.
* The training data set consist of 8000 images i.e. 4000 images of cats and 4000 images of dogs.
## 8. Model Evaluation:
* Use the validation dataset to evaluate your model's performance.
* Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves for binary classification.
## 9. Model Fine-Tuning (Optional):
* If the model's performance is not satisfactory, consider adjusting hyperparameters, adding more layers, or increasing training epochs.
* In this project, I have used model fine_tuning for k-NN algorith by adjusting k values to get better accuracy.
## 10. Testing:
* After you're satisfied with your model's performance on the validation dataset, test it on the test dataset (which consist of 2000 images i.e. 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs) to get a final evaluation of its accuracy.
